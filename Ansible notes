Ansible

	• Ansible is Configuration Management tool
	• Provisioning, application deployment, orchestration
	• Ansible uses ssh to login to remote host no need to install agent i.e., agentless
	• Ansible also implemented pull based for few use cases.
ansible all -i <IP>, -e ansible_user=ec2-user -e ansible_password=DevOps321 -m ping

	• Control Node: node/server which is installed Ansible
	• Manage Node:  nodes which you want to run tasks from ansible
	• inventory: list of manage nodes
	• modules: The input code of Ansible executes. Each module have specific functionality in ansible
	• Playbook: playbook means set of actions we want to perform on manage nodes.
                             we will use modules to write playbooks
